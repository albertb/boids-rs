An implementation of the [Boid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) algorithm in Rust. I wrote this to learn about Rust and [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) so the code is probably not great.


# Demo
There's a demo available at http://albertb.github.io/boids-rs. It's the Rust code compiled to WebAssembly.

Here's a quick screenshot of what it looks like:
